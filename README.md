# Simple Retirement Model

## Introduction

Hi, I'm Naman Choudhary, and this project is a simple retirement model built using Python. The goal of this model is to help you estimate how many years you have left until retirement based on your current savings, expected annual return, and retirement goals.

## What the Code Does

The code takes the following inputs:
- Salary
- Investment Rate
- Savings Rate
- Desired retirement amount

Based on these inputs, it calculates how many years it will take for you to reach your retirement goal.

## Installation

To use the model, you need to have Python installed on your computer. You also need to install the required libraries:
